2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress. It's listed as ACF Webforms.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Can I use ACF Webform to create/edit posts? =
Yes just as ACF supports this via it's front-end forms, we create a no-code way to make post create or edit forms. Unlike webforms you make for display your post create/edit forms won't have submission handling. Which is usually fine, because the goal is to provide editing capability instead.
